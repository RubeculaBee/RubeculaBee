# Welcome to my world.

Good day ðŸ‘‹. It's nice to meet you, my name is Robin, a novice code editor with grand ambitions. If you're reading this, you probably would like to know more about me. Let's go over that!

## About Me

I've been a nerd about computers since I was young, obtaining my first personal computer, a chunky *Dell* laptop, at the age of 7 years old, gifted to me by my father. Growing up in the relatively small town of Manteca CA did not offer me many opportunities, so as soon as I was able I took a journey to the Bay Area, where I now find myself to be in attendence at [San Francisco State University](https://www.sfsu.edu/), studying the world of Computer Science.
